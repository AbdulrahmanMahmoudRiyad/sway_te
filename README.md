# Sway - Text Editor

**sway** is a work-in-progress text editor, designed to offer a visually dynamic coding experience. Its interface combines a minimalist design with camera actions that creates a fluid, immersive editing experience to create an engaging workflow for children and newcomers.

## Key Features:
- **Dynamic Font Scaling**: When you start typing, the font size appears large and gradually decreases until stabilizing at a comfortable size. This is achieved through custom camera zooming rather than actual font resizing.
- **Camera Actions**: The editor has built-in camera actions that follow the cursor as you type, zooming in and out, making your text more visible when needed, and providing a smooth experience for code navigation.
- **SDL2, OpenGL, and FreeType Integration**: Sway uses graphics libraries to provide smooth rendering, font rendering, and shader-based effects.

## Future Enhancements:
- **File Management**
- **Key Bindings**
- **Enhanced UI Elements**

This project is still in development and aims to become a fully functional and customizable text editor for new programmers.

## Build and Run
This project requires the following libraries to be installed: SDL2, GLEW, OpenGL, and FreeType. You can build the project using CMake with your preferred IDE or terminal.

## Contributing
Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements. The project is a work in progress, and contributions are welcome!
